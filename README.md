[Git conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)

## Note

The basic structure for the folders have already been set up. Create your files and add assets in the appropriate folders.

Regarding casing:

- use 'PascalCase' for every files and components folder. There's exception for custom hooks which should be done using camelCase.

- Name the components in your files in 'PascalCase'. [Learn more here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65508199/function-is-declared-but-its-value-is-never-read-react)

### Redundant codes

Always remeber to remove any code you're not making use of. This include redundant variables, console.logs, functions, dependencies, imports, etc.

This will prevent our server log from being piled up with unnecessary warnings.
